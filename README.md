<b>TUCAN: A molecular identifier and descriptor for all domains of chemistry</b>

Etymology: TUCAN stands for "<i>tu canonicalización</i>" since we hope that it will be of use to you to canonicalize your molecules. And besides that, the tucán is a friendly bird with a colorful look which captures everybodies attention, much like we expect this software will: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toco_toucan
